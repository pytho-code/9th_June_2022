Python Class

"""class ABC:
    x=5
    
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age


The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
