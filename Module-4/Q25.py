"""
Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is
A Constructor In Python?

It represents real-world relationships well.
It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.



The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
